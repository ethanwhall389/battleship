This project was the final project in the Javascript course as part of The Odin Project. 

Objectives:
 - Learn the basics of unit testing using Jest.
 - Show advanced knowledge of Vanilla JS by completing a complicated project.

 This project challenged me greatly, but I'm very happy to see it working in its completion. A few of the areas I feel I learned the most in were the testing portion, as well as attempting to make the AI "smart" in the way it attacks.
