# battleship

Needed implementations:

--hide enemy board's ships from user
--homescreen for entering player name
--system for adding ships (drag and drop?)

Edge cases:

--user can make attacks even when it isn't his turn.

--user can attack by clicking on a coordinate on their own board, which attacks that coordinate on opponents board.
